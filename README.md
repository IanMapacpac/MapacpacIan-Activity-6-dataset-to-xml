# i accidentally typed a wrong command in gitbash resulting to something i am unfamiliar. i typed "git push -n origin master. instead of -u, i typed -n and 
# when i checked my repository there is only one commit posted but when i looked closely, there are actually 3 commit history, 
# i just cared about one of the instructions where i should make at least 2 commits, though i made 3, my professor might not notice it and might see only one commit
# i hope i made myself clear po hehe thank you fo understanding sir.
